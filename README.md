# Auto-Plot

A simple program that take file input from a user and creates a bar graph. It was my first program that I ever created, so go easy on the judgment!

The user is prompted to pivot the data based on the columns of the imported file. 
Then the user can pick a color for the plot based on the standard colors provided by the matplotlib library.

The colors plot was borrowed from https://matplotlib.org/examples/color/named_colors.html
